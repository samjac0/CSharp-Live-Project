# CSharp-Live-Project
After completing the C# course, I participated in a week-long sprint. I was tasked with using C# within the .net framework to assist with a partion of a theature's website. Specifically, I was assigned to the production team, and tasked to build the pages that met narrow specifications.

## Crud Functionality and Code-First Approach
This view function saves the details of the cartoon to the database that the user inputs into the form.
```cs
    def CreateCartoon(request):
        form = CartoonForm(data=request.POST or None)
        if request.method=='POST':
            if form.is_valid():
                form.save()
                return redirect('Cartoons_home')
        context = {'form': form}
        return render(request, "Cartoons/Cartoons_create.html", context)
```
This view function allows the user to edit/update a cartoon's details.
```cs
    def UpdateItem(request, pk):
        item = Cartoon.Cartoons.get(pk=pk)
        form = CartoonForm(request.POST or None, instance=item)

        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
            return redirect('Cartoons_list')

        context = {'item': item, 'form': form}
        return render(request, 'Cartoons/Cartoons_up_date.html', context)
```
This view function enables a user to delete cartoons from the database.
```cs
    def DeleteItem(request, pk):
        context = {}
        item = get_object_or_404(Cartoon, pk=pk)

        if request.method == "POST":
            item.delete()
            return redirect("Cartoons_list")

        return render(request, "Cartoons/Cartoons_delete.html", context)
```

## Connect to API
After creating a new API template, I rendered it with a view function. I then researched API documentation in order to connect the API and write a basic JSON response that allows users to search a word in the Oxford Dictionary and view its definition. I included additional functionality that saves each word and definition that was searched into a database. Next, I created a new template for displaying the previously searched words/definitions. As an extra feature, I added an input in the navbar that allows users to utilize the dictionary API. After entering a word and clicking search, they are redirected to the API template where the word that was searched and its corresponding definition are displayed.

views.py:
```cs
    def OxfordAPI(request):
        # set up api connection
        app_id='591386c7'
        app_key='ea768fd0e3d3a96ec8b39d08533c1f36'
        language='en-us'
        fields ='definitions'
        strictMatch ='false'
        # create empty list
        definition=[]
        if request.method=='POST':
            value=request.POST['word_id'].lower()
            # if input is blank it will display this message
            if value=="":
                messages.info(request, 'Please enter a search term')
            else:
                url ='https://od-api.oxforddictionaries.com:443/api/v2/entries/' + language + '/' + value + '?fields=' + fields + '&strictMatch=' + strictMatch;
                info=requests.get(url,headers={'app_id':app_id, 'app_key':app_key})
                oxford_info=info.json()
                result=oxford_info['results'][0]['lexicalEntries'][0]['entries'][0]['senses'][0]['definitions'][0]
                definition.append(result)

                save_definition = Definition.Definitions.create(
                    value=value,
                    definition=definition
                )
                save_definition.save()

            context={'value':value,'definition':definition}
            # if input is not blank then it will return the context
            return render(request, 'Cartoons/Cartoons_api.html', context)
        else:
            return render(request, 'Cartoons/Cartoons_api.html')
```

I then created a new object model class with a manager to our models.py for saving words/definitions.

models.py:
```cs
    class Definition(models.Model):
        value = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        definition = models.TextField(max_length=100)

        Definitions = models.Manager()

        def __str__(self):
            return self.value
```
Finally, I added a view function for rendering all the words/definitions in the database.

views.py:
```cs
    def DisplayDefinitions(request):
        definition_list = Definition.Definitions.all().order_by("value")
        context = {'definition_list': definition_list}
        return render(request, 'Cartoons/Cartoons_definitions.html', context)
```

## Beautiful Soup
Using the Python package Beautiful Soup, I parsed data from two websites to display a top ten animated series list and a top 100 animated movies list on two newly created templates that can be accessed from both the navbar and homepage.

The following code scrapes the number and titles of the cartoons from Indiewireâ€™s website where they have ranked the best animated series of all time. There are over 60 cartoons on the list and about ten are displayed per page, so I selected the specific page that named the top ten cartoons. The titles are all under "h3" tags in the HTML code.

views.py:
```cs
    def CartoonScrape(request):
        # Create empty list.
        top_cartoons = []
        # Set up BeautifulSoup.
        source = requests.get("https://www.indiewire.com/feature/best-animated-series-all-time-cartoons-anime-tv-1202021835/5/")
        bs = BeautifulSoup(source.content, 'html.parser')
        # Get all the h3 tags under the div 'entry-content' from source site.
        rankings = bs.find('div', class_='entry-content')
        rank = rankings.find_all('h3')
        # For loop through the h3 tags but in reverse order (because they are displayed reversed on the source page).
        for h3 in reversed(rank):
            titles = h3.text
            top_cartoons.append(titles)
        # Delete indexes 8-9 which are irrelevant h3 tags.
        del top_cartoons[8:10]

        context = {'top_cartoons': top_cartoons}
        return render(request, 'Cartoons/Cartoons_rankings.html', context)
```

Furthermore, the code below scrapes the ranking/rating/titles of the top 100 animated movies on the Rotten Tomatoes website.

views.py:
```cs
    def MovieScrape(request):
        # Create empty list.
        top_movies = []
        # Set up BeautifulSoup.
        source = requests.get("https://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt/top_100_animation_movies/")
        bs = BeautifulSoup(source.content, 'html.parser')
        # Get all the "a" tags under the table 'table' from source site.
        rankings = bs.find('table', class_='table')
        rank = rankings.find_all('tr')
        # For loop that iterates through all the "a" tags.
        for tr in rank:
            titles = tr.text
            top_movies.append(titles)
        # Delete index 0, which is not needed.
        del top_movies[0]

        context = {'top_movies': top_movies}
        return render(request, 'Cartoons/Cartoons_movies.html', context)
```

## Conclusion
The Python live project provided me with my first full-scale opportunity to utilize project methodologies and gain a detailed understanding of version control. I worked with other students within an Agile framework environment on the Microsoft Azure DevOps platform. I was able to make commits, merges, and push/pulls in real-time while being aware of how to minimize merge conflicts. I participated in daily standup meetings to discuss progress and roadblocks, as well as a retrospective meeting upon completion of the app. I really enjoyed this process and look forward to utilizing everything learned from this sprint in future projects!
